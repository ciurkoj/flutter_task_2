# flutter_task_2

In this task I was asked to use [Space Flight News Api](https://spaceflightnewsapi.net/)
The App is fetching space news and puts them in a list, as a user I can click on an item in the list an a modal widget will pop up with more information about the article. I can close it by clicking the 'X' button or anywhere outside of the modal. A user can also add articles to a favourite list and view them on a separate screen. Both list are synced with a Provider and can be editted from both screens.  

## Getting Started

Please make sure you have flutter installed on your computer and then use ```flutter pub get && flutter run``` to start the app
